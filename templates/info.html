<h1> About Our Project: </h1>
 <p> Our project was to challenge ourselves by creating an original web application within a team. After brainstorming
     several ideas we came up with the idea to develop a web application that makes it easier to connect students with
     faculty members at their respective schools. Inspired by twitter we created a home feed for the users of the
     application to socialize and connect with members of their school. The application delivers a home page, which
     contains the feed. A profile page, which users can customize their experience and their appearance on the app.
     And lastly, this page which details more information about the project itself. We chose to create this web
     application to bring an easier method of creating the necessary relationships with professors, faculty and other
     staff members between students that could benefit and propel their academic success and even provide potential
     opportunities after obtaining their degrees.</p>
